# ETB_ClientButton
A reusable source for Mod Developers of ETB (Escape The Backrooms) that wants a button to check if clients interacted with something without the need of everyone using the mod. This mod uses an ingame object with custom functions that will work across the network and able to trigger other things by Developer choices.
